**Image-Based Fashion Recommendation System Using Deep Learning**
**Introduction**
This project explores image-driven fashion recommendations using deep learning, specifically leveraging ResNet50 for visual feature extraction. Unlike conventional systems that rely on user behavior or product metadata, this approach focuses purely on image similarity, analyzing clothing textures, patterns, and designs to suggest visually relevant fashion items.
Project Objectives
- Implement a ResNet50-based fashion recommendation system that identifies similar clothing items based on their visual characteristics.
- Extract meaningful deep learning-based features from fashion images to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Optimize the feature extraction process using pre-trained ResNet50, ensuring high-quality representations of clothing textures and styles.
- Develop an interactive web-based interface that allows users to upload an image and receive top matching fashion recommendations.

  
**Methodology**
Feature Extraction with ResNet50
- The system uses ResNet50, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on large-scale image datasets.
- Each fashion image is processed through ResNet50, extracting deep visual features representing textures, colors, and clothing patterns.
- These extracted features form a numeric embedding, which is later used to compare and retrieve visually similar items.
  
Image Similarity Matching
- The extracted feature embeddings are stored in a structured format.
- When a user uploads a new clothing image, the system compares its ResNet50 features with precomputed embeddings to find the most visually similar items.
- The recommendations are displayed through a user-friendly web interface.
